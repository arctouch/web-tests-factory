## How to insert a new test framework on this project

We will assume that this new framework will work on the main existing script struct. If the new framework needs different steps, feel free to adapt this script and suggest changes as a new Pull Request

Based on the implementation for Jest Framework:

1. Insert a new FRAMEWORK_MOCK and FRAMEWORK_TEST. Like on next:

```bash
JEST_TEST="import {testingMock} from \"./mocks/className\"
describe ('Verify testingMethod using testingMock to validate the scenario ABC', () => {
	test(' testingMock validate scenario A ', () => {
		expect(testingMethod(testingMock)).toEqual(\"Scenario A is success\");
	});
});"

JEST_MOCK="const testingMock= \"Scenario A is success\";"
```

2. Insert a new if, with all the information that is necessary for create a new test.

```bash
if FRAMEWORK_REFERENCE_NUMBER=1; then
  FRAMEWORK_NAME="Jest"
  TEST_FOLDER="tests"
  TEST_MOCK_FOLDER="tests/mocks"
  TEST_FILE="tests/className.test.js"
  MOCK_FILE="tests/mocks/classNameMock.js"
  FRAMEWORK_MOCK=JEST_MOCK
  FRAMEWORK_TEST=JEST_TEST
fi
```

3. On this project, insert your new test inside the folder: **defaultTests/yourFrameworkName**. This will not do anything, it is just to have an easy way for seeing all the tests inside the script.

4. This is all! Your new test could be produced using the factory tests script!
